Create an application that allows the user to draw polygons (filled/hollow) on a screen. The application should be able to do the following:

- Draw a polygon on the screen. The user can choose to draw a hollow or filled polygon.
    - The user can draw multiple polygons; the program must be able to store the data of multiple polygons.
- Delete a polygon.
- Toggle the filled/hollow properties of a polygon.
- Change the color of a polygon.
- Set the priority of a polygon (front/behind).
- Edit/delete a point of a polygon on the screen.

- Bonus points for user friendliness. Negative points for extreme user unfriendliness.
